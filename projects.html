    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <h2>Safety and Education</h2>
    <p>
      Violence can touch anyone, but it is especially targeted at LGBTQ folks, communities of color,
      and the working class. It is our purpose to give people the skills necessary to protect
      themselves and one another. Between learning how to use pepper spray, taking a class from a
      medic regarding protest safety, or even learning to shoot a gun for the very first time, there are
      so many ways we can help you prepare for anything that might come your way.
    </p>
    <h2>Mutual Aid</h2>
    <p>
      Community defense means more than just responding to physical violence; it also means
      responding to the economic violence being perpetrated against our communities every day. Our
      members are already engaged in many local outreach and charity efforts. Being a part of our
      chapter allows them and their group to get financial or operational assistance from hundreds of
      like-minded comrades. The chapter is also quickly developing mutual aid projects of our own,
      come back soon to learn more!
    </p>
    <h2>Meet-Ups</h2>
    <p>
      Being a part of the SRA means joining a group of people who have your best interest at heart.
      Members routinely look for fellow comrades to attend ranges with, partake in local mutual aid
      efforts, or simply get to know one another over a bite to eat. Does somebody have a particular
      firearm you've been thinking about purchasing, but you want to see how it feels first? Are you
      looking to have a constructive discussion on political theory and hear from different ideological
      perspectives? Are you thinking about unionizing your workplace but you want to hear from
      somebody who's been there and done it before? All you've got to do is ask!
    </p>
    <h2>Wiki</h2>
    <p>
      The internet is a tool that has done wonders for the democratization of information. We are
      creating a <a href="https://wiki.ma-sra.org">Wiki</a> that contains information on FFLs, instructors, classes, shops, laws, products,
      and lots of other stuff that a Massachusetts resident may find useful when learning how to
      protect their community. From this pool of knowledge, we hope you will take as needed and
      contribute as able.

    <h1>Projects We Like</h1>
    <h2>Comrade Center</h2>
    <p>
      The Comrade Center is a fledgling initiative started by SRA members that has since grown into
      a broader coalition of workers across New England. Their goal is to create and operate a shooting range where all
      people, especially those from marginalized communities, feel comfortable to learn about all of
      the aspects of community defense in accordance with our mission.
      To learn more about Comrade Center, and to contribute or get involved, check out the website
      <a href="https://comradecenter.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.
